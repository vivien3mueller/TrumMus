could actually lead to extortion and blackmail of a President. The other 
side would say, “If you don’t do something, just the way we want it, we

Many actions for the benefit of our Country will not be taken. This is in 
no way what the Founders had in mind. Legal Experts and Scholars have

my leadership, the Republican Party will always support the creation of 
strong, thriving, healthy American families. We want to make it easier for 
mothers and fathers to have babies, not harder! That includes supporting 
the availability of fertility treatments like IVF in every State in 
America. Like the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of Americans, including the VAST 
MAJORITY of Republicans, Conservatives, Christians, and Pro-Life 
Americans, I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are 
trying to have a precious baby. Today, I am calling on the Alabama 
Legislature to act quickly to find an immediate solution to preserve the 
availability of IVF in Alabama. The Republican Party should always be on 
the side of the Miracle of Life - and the side of Mothers, Fathers, and 
their Beautiful Babies. IVF is an important part of that, and our Great 
Republican Party will always be with you, in your quest, for the ULTIMATE 
JOY IN 
LIFE!</p>"},{"date":1708711689127,"favorites":11989,"id":"111982129258766598","isRetweet":false,"retweets":3085,"text":"<p>Join

WAS ONLY WORTH $18,000,000, WHEN IT IS WORTH 50 TO 100 TIMES THAT AMOUNT.

ACCEPTED TO BE WORTH MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THIS ALL FIT THE FAKE 
NARRATIVE OF THE CORRUPT AND MANY TIMES  OVERTURNED “JUDGE,” AND THE 
RADICAL LEFT, SOROS BACKED, SLOB OF AN ATTORNEY GENERAL, WHOSE PRIMARY 
GOAL IS, IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE WHITE HOUSE, AND LIKE ALL OF THE 
OTHER LITIGATION AGAINST ME, AN ATTACK ON CROOKED JOE BIDEN’S POLITICAL 
OPPONENT, ME! SAME STORY IN GEORGIA, NEW YORK (D.A.), &amp; WASHINGTON

on me and my family, this biased, Trump Hating Judge, ignored all this, 
and even said Michael Cohen told the truth, although Cohen admitted to 
lying hundreds of times, and lied right in front of the Judge during the 
trial. This shocking and corrupt Interference in the Free Markets for 
political gain places every New York business transaction at risk. We must 
make sure Corrupt Politicians and Judges cannot continue to abuse the 
power of their office, and violate the public trust. We have already won, 
and will continue the fight on 
appeal!</p>"},{"date":1708119358116,"favorites":18451,"id":"111943310253470500","isRetweet":false,"retweets":5486,"text":"<p>A

me by Deutsche Bank because they were so proud of the Loan they made. They 
had the best Lawyers, the smartest Loan Officers, and were thrilled to do 
business with “TRUMP.” Interest was fully paid every month (no payment 
ever missed!), never received a default notice, and if Interest came due 
on a weekend, I paid it on a Friday. THE LOAN WAS PAID OFF FAR AHEAD OF 
SCHEDULE! Except for me, because of the Corrupt DOJ, FBI, and Racist New 
York State Attorney General, there were no Victims, there were only happy 
Bankers! But despite a PERFECT LOAN, I was sued by the Incompetent, 
Radical Left New York State AG, Letitia “Peekaboo” James, under a Statute 
that was never used for this before, and where I am not even entitled to a 
Jury. A Liberal Democrat Judge, with all Trump Haters surrounding him, is 
going to make this very important decision. If I had a Jury, I would win 
easily, but regardless, this is a case that should never have been 
brought. ELECTION

“Peekaboo” James is a corrupt Attorney General, who knew nothing about my 
tremendously successful business, but still campaigned on, “I will get

established that my Net Worth exceeded that which was reported in my 
Financial Statements, and those Statements never included my most Valuable 
Asset, The TRUMP Brand. The politically biased Judge on this Rigged Case 
refused to acknowledge that the Appellate Division has already ruled in my 
favor on Statute of Limitations, and effectively ended this litigation. 
The Judge has been overturned four times, during this trial alone, a

on D.C. Court of Appeals Presidential Immunity ruling:</p><p>\"The U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruling that 
President Donald Trump does not have immunity from prosecution sets a 
dangerous precedent, violates our Constitution, and threatens the very 
bedrock of our nation. President Trump's actions surrounding election 
integrity were within his official duties as the President as he was 
investigating legitimate Constitutional questions about the election. The 
precedent set today by the D.C. Circuit's decision means that future 
presidents who leave office will likely face politicized prosecutions by 
the opposing party. The President of the United States must have immunity, 
like Members of Congress and federal judges, which is necessary for any 
presidency to function properly. I fully support President Trump's efforts 
to appeal this unconstitutional ruling to the Supreme Court, where I 
expect a thoughtful decision to overturn this dangerous 
precedent.\"</p>"},{"date":1707323816504,"favorites":9469,"id":"111891173638900296","isRetweet":false,"retweets":2728,"text":"<p><a

Servicemembers, and wounding many more, marks a horrible day for America. 
My most profound sympathies go to the Families of the Brave Servicemembers 
we have lost. I ask all Americans to join me in praying for those who have 
been wounded. This brazen attack on the United States is yet another 
horrific and tragic consequence of Joe Biden’s weakness and 
surrender….</p>"},{"date":1706468045519,"favorites":20667,"id":"111835089828882966","isRetweet":false,"retweets":5782,"text":"<p>Page 
Two: Three years ago, Iran was weak, broke, and totally under control. 
Thanks to my Maximum Pressure policy, the Iranian Regime could barely 
scrape two dollars together to fund their terrorist proxies. Then Joe 
Biden came in and gave Iran billions of dollars, which the Regime has used 
to spread bloodshed and carnage throughout the Middle East. This attack 
would NEVER have happened if I was President, not even a chance - Just 
like the Iranian-backed Hamas attack on Israel would never have happened, 
the War in Ukraine would never have happened, and we would right now have 
Peace throughout the World. Instead, we are on the brink of World War 
3…..</p>"},{"date":1706468040079,"favorites":19975,"id":"111835089472298402","isRetweet":false,"retweets":5416,"text":"<p>Page

return to PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, so that there will be no more chaos, no 
more destruction, and no more loss of precious American lives. Our Country

York: “Tech billionaire Reid Hoffman is bankrolling Carroll’s case. Like 
so many others involved on Carroll’s side, Hoffman is profoundly 
anti-Trump. He is also not afraid to push the envelope of anti-Trumpism; 
in 2018, he apologized for funding a group that secretly imitated Russian 
disinformation tactics in an attempt to benefit the Dem in Alabama’s 
special election for the U.S. Senate. Hoffman’s money has made some waves 
in the Carroll case because, in her October 2022 deposition, Carroll 
denied that anyone was paying her legal fees. Here is what Carroll 
said:<br/> <br/>Q: Are you presently paying your counsel’s fees?<br/> 
<br/>A: This is a contingency case.<br/> <br/>Q: So you’re not paying 
expenses or anything out of pocket to date. Is that correct?<br/> <br/>A: 
I’m not sure about expenses. I have to look that up.<br/> <br/>Q: Is 
anyone else paying your legal fees, Ms. Carroll?<br/> <br/>A: No.<br/>

York: “Tech billionaire Reid Hoffman is bankrolling Carroll’s case. Like 
so many others involved on Carroll’s side, Hoffman is profoundly 
anti-Trump. He is also not afraid to push the envelope of anti-Trumpism; 
in 2018, he apologized for funding a group that secretly imitated Russian 
disinformation tactics in an attempt to benefit the Democrat in Alabama’s 
special election for the U.S. Senate. Hoffman’s money has made some waves 
in the Carroll case because, in her October 2022 deposition, Carroll 
denied that anyone was paying her legal fees. Here is what Carroll 
said:</p><p>Q: Are you presently paying your counsel’s fees?</p><p>A: This 
is a contingency case.</p><p>Q: So you’re not paying expenses or anything 
out of pocket to date. Is that correct?</p><p>A: I’m not sure about 
expenses. I have to look that up.</p><p>Q: Is anyone else paying your

can vote in the New Hampshire Republican Primary. He was so anxious to go 
against me, that he fell into the proverbial “Trump” trap, just like all 
others do. In actuality, Democrats can vote, they had to register by 
October 6, but they can come in as Independents, and then can be 
Democrats, and nobody’s going to know, so already we have 3,542 Democrats 
changed to Undeclared, 408 to Republican (all of whom will be voting), and 
others will come in as Liberals or Independents. Their rationale is that 
they are desperate to stop “Trump,” because they don’t want to run against 
me, they want to run against Nikki or Ron or anyone else. If an 
Independent is a Democrat, they can vote. That’s what they want to do,

Two: At the first trial, Judge Kaplan should have recused himself, as

abuse of power—No wonder our Country is going to Hell! The second trial is 
a totally separate case from the first one, so the Jury should decide on 
guilt, which does not exist, instead of a reward, which I should get, not 
her. This Judge is not allowing that, he is not allowing me to properly 
defend myself from false accusations, he’s taking the unfair decision in 
the first trial, which we are appealing, and sticking selected parts of it 
into this trial. As to guilt or innocence, he is wrongfully forcing 
guilty, which is unAmerican. We have a very bad and hostile Judge, but 
we’re fighting all the way.

special election for the US Senate. Hoffman’s $$ has made some waves in 
the Carroll case because, in her October 2022 deposition, Carroll denied 
that anyone was paying her legal fees. Here is what Carroll said:<br/> 
<br/>Q: Are you presently paying your counsel’s fees?<br/> <br/>A: This is 
a contingency case.<br/> <br/>Q: So you’re not paying expenses or anything 
out of pocket to date. Is that correct?<br/> <br/>A: I’m not sure about 
expenses. I have to look that up.<br/> <br/>Q: Is anyone else paying your 
legal fees, Ms. Carroll?<br/> <br/>A: No.<br/> <br/>As the trial 
approached, Kaplan, Carroll’s lawyer, wrote to the Trump legal team to 
admit that what Carroll said was not 
true.”</p>"},{"date":1705416043171,"favorites":6989,"id":"111766145805338698","isRetweet":false,"retweets":1974,"text":"<p>Vanity

such an egregious pattern of behavior, surely we’d expect to find some
