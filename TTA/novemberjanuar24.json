large crowds of people forming, but before I do, I want to thank almost 
everybody, even perceived opponents from the “other side” politically, who 
have spoken up against the Radical Left, Soros backed, New York State 
Attorney General, who yesterday asked me to pay a “fine” of $370,000,000, 
plus other harmful things to N.Y., after a years long Witch Hunt, for 
essentially borrowing money from a bank, and paying the bank back, ahead 
of schedule. There were no defaults, discounts, or anything other than 
profits for the bank. “THEY WERE TWO PERFECT LOANS,” and the bank in 
question testified that the loans were great, and FAR SMALLER THAN THE 
FINE. I didn’t even need the money, the bank wanted to make the loans - 
That’s what they do, make loans. Additionally, I won the Appeal in the 
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, and the Judge refused to accept 
their decision, A FIRST. Also, great Financial

Hemingway, The Federalist: “The 2020 presidential election was unlike any 
in American history. Hundreds of laws and processes were changed in the 
months leading up to the election…Powerful tech oligarchs and corrupt 
propaganda press conspired to keep indisputably important news stories, 
such as allegations of corruption regarding the Biden family business, 
hidden from voters in the weeks prior to voting. Information operations 
were routinely manufactured about President Trump in the closing months of 
the campaign…The propaganda press have also downplayed Zuckerberg’s 
staggering $419 million expenditure…The funds were used mostly to register 
Democrats to vote, encourage Democrats to vote, harvest Democrat ballots, 
cure defective Democrat ballots, count Democrat ballots, etc. No 
right-wing billionaire could have gotten away with even thinking about 
such an operation, but had he, the media would be all over it.” <a

Davis Hanson: “The FBI did not merely engage in ‘correspondence’ with 
Twitter to protect the company and its ‘customers.’ Instead, it 
effectively hired Twitter to suppress the free expression of some of its 
users, as well as news stories deemed unhelpful to the Biden campaign and 
administration… Moreover, the FBI sought to contract out Twitter (at 
roughly $3.5 million) as a veritable subsidiarity to suppress social media 
traffic about the laptop and speech the bureau deemed improper…The media, 
Twitter, Facebook, and former intelligence operatives were all following 
the FBI’s own preliminary warning bulletin that ‘Foreign Actors and 
Cybercriminals Likely to Spread Disinformation Regarding 2020 Election 
Results’—even as the bureau knew the laptop in its possession was most 
certainly not Russian disinformation. And, of course, the FBI had helped 
spread the Russian collusion hoax in 2016.” <a

C. McCarthy: “Reading between the lines of all available evidence, you can 
find an organized effort by the bureau to put its thumb on the scale for 
Biden’s campaign. I can appreciate clever. It’s when people—especially 
government officials—insult my intelligence that I get angry. And we 
should all be angry over the United States government’s interference in 
the 2020 presidential election, hot on the heels of its self-abasement 
during and in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election. The FBI, as 
the pointy end of the executive-branch spear, would have us believe that 
it in no way intentionally interfered in the 2020 election. Yet the 
evidence that it did so, and that its doing so was part of a yearslong 
pattern, is by leaps &amp; bounds stronger than the evidence that the 
Trump campaign corruptly conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 
election—the baseless allegation, energetically promoted by the bureau, 
that inflamed the country for two years.” <a

Ball, Time Magazine: “To the President, something felt amiss. ‘It was all 
very, very strange,’ Trump said on Dec. 2. ‘Within days after the 
election, we witnessed an orchestrated effort to anoint the winner, even 
while many key states were still being counted.’ In a way, Trump was 
right. There was a conspiracy unfolding behind the scenes…Their work 
touched every aspect of the election. They got states to change voting 
systems and laws and helped secure hundreds of millions in public and 
private funding. They fended off voter-suppression lawsuits, recruited 
armies of poll workers and got millions of people to vote by mail for the 
first time. They successfully pressured social media companies…” <a

York: “Tech billionaire Reid Hoffman is bankrolling Carroll’s case. Like 
so many others involved on Carroll’s side, Hoffman is profoundly 
anti-Trump. He is also not afraid to push the envelope of anti-Trumpism; 
in 2018, he apologized for funding a group that secretly imitated Russian 
disinformation tactics in an attempt to benefit the Democrat in Alabama’s 
special election for the U.S. Senate. Hoffman’s $$ has made some waves in 
the Carroll case because, in her Oct 2022 deposition, Carroll denied that 
anyone was paying her legal fees. Here is what Carroll said:<br/> <br/>Q: 
Are you presently paying your counsel’s fees?<br/> <br/>A: This is a 
contingency case.<br/> <br/>Q: So you’re not paying expenses or anything 
out of pocket to date. Is that correct?<br/> <br/>A: I’m not sure about 
expenses. I have to look that up.<br/> <br/>Q: Is anyone else paying your

Becker, Becker News: “An Election Integrity review conducted on 92 court 
challenges filed over the 2020 election found that a clear majority of the 
cases decided on the merits were ruled favorably for the plaintiffs; 
particularly, the Republican Party and the Trump campaign…‘You’re gonna 
wanna bookmark this,’ remarked Arizona Sun Times reporter @ Rach_IC. ‘This 
is a compilation of all of the 2020 election challenges and what became of 
them. Despite the MSM lies that 60+ election challenges found no evidence 
of wrongdoing, there were actually 92 cases, with only 30 decided on the 
merits, and of those 30, Trump and/or the GOP plaintiff prevailed in 22 of 
them’…many states have since decided that 2020 election practices such as 
the inclusion of privately funded ‘Zuckerboxes’ were either illegal or 
were subsequently outlawed…Thus debunks a widespread narrative: Trump’s 
legal challenges to the 2020 election were all 
‘baseless.’”</p>"},{"date":1704381104990,"favorites":6958,"id":"111698320096792017","isRetweet":false,"retweets":2860,"text":"<p></p>"},{"date":1704381092019,"favorites":5609,"id":"111698319246774389","isRetweet":false,"retweets":2018,"text":"<p></p>"},{"date":1704381062501,"favorites":5418,"id":"111698317312477869","isRetweet":false,"retweets":1923,"text":"<p></p>"},{"date":1704381008692,"favorites":5267,"id":"111698313785789368","isRetweet":false,"retweets":1857,"text":"<p></p>"},{"date":1704380719767,"favorites":5427,"id":"111698294850522779","isRetweet":false,"retweets":2187,"text":"<p><a

ELECTION FRAUD IN THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN THE SWING STATES: I am 
pleased to share a Report that is fully verified, most of the information 
was gotten from Government Sources, Tapes, and other Public Records, and 
compiled by the most highly qualified Election Experts in the Country. 
These numbers are determinative and, in all cases, are hundreds of 
thousands of Votes per Swing State more than I needed to WIN that State. 
If the Republican Senate does not step forward and address this ATROCITY, 
it will happen again, and be virtually impossible for Republicans to WIN 
ELECTIONS in the future. <a

was not campaigning—The 2020 Election was LONG OVER. What I was doing is 
bringing to light the fact that the Election was, without question, Rigged 
and Stolen. As President, and Commander-in-Chief, it was my duty to do so! 
If I did not do this, I would have been in violation of my Oath of Office, 
and the Take Care Clause, which requires the President to “take Care that 
the Laws be faithfully executed.” Therefore I am entitled to Total 
Immunity, because that is exactly what I was doing, Taking Care of our 
Country, and Guarding it from Rigged and Stolen Elections. Democrats are 
willing to play a far different game. They are willing to Cheat at levels 
never seen before. <a

these numbers carefully, analyze what’s been done, keep an open mind, and 
be smart—Because the Democrats are already trying to do it again, but 
adding one more weapon, Prosecutorial Misconduct—Using the DOJ, FBI, and 
local Attorney Generals and D.A.’s to go after Crooked Joe Biden’s 
Political Opponent—ME. This is a Lethal Weapon, but so far my Record Poll 
Numbers would indicate that it has backfired on them. The Public knows the

Fleitz: “Given a growing perception that Biden may be a one-term president 
who will be succeeded in January 2025 by a new president who will take 
aggressive action to close the border, the United States will likely see 
the largest surge of illegal immigration in history in 2024 as migrants 
from around the world rush to Mexico to take advantage of Biden’s weak 
border security policies...Xi is worried that President Donald Trump could 
be reelected in November 2024. Xi believes Trump will have a much tougher 
China policy and prefers to continue to deal with Biden, whom he views as 
a considerably weaker president than Trump.” <a

Poll: “17% of mail-in voters admit that in 2020 they voted in a state 
where they are ‘no longer a permanent resident.’ 21% of mail-in voters 
admitted that they filled out a ballot for a friend or family member. 17% 
of mail-in voters said they signed a ballot for a friend or family member 
‘with or without his or her permission.’ 8% of likely voters say they were 
offered ‘pay’ or a ‘reward’ for voting in 2020. Taken together, the 
results of these survey questions appear to show that voter fraud was 
widespread in the 2020 election, especially among those who cast mail-in 
ballots.” <a

million undeliverable, 560,814 rejected, 14.7 million ‘unknown’…In some 
places, it can be difficult to understand how large these numbers really 
are. Consider the undeliverable ballots. President Joe Biden carried 
Arizona by 10,457 votes, yet Maricopa County reportedly sent ballots to 
110,092 outdated or wrong addresses. The same scenario roughly happened in 
Nevada, where Biden carried with 33,596 votes, yet Clark County bounced

Devine: “In Michigan, 500 mules averaged 50 drop box visits, at five 
ballots per drop, giving you 125,000 suspect votes…In Wisconsin, 100 mules 
averaged 28 drop box visits each, which gives us 14,000 suspect votes…in 
Georgia, where 250 mules averaged 24 drop box visits each, we get 30,000 
suspect votes, more than enough to overcome Biden’s 12,000 vote advantage. 
D’Souza moves Georgia’s 16 electoral votes into the Trump column. In 
Arizona, 200 mules averaging 20 drop box visits makes 20,000 suspect 
votes, giving another 11 hypothetical electoral votes to Trump. In 
Philadelphia alone, 1,100 mules averaged 50 drop box visits giving us 
275,000 suspect votes which would flip the Pennsylvania result to Trump, 
giving him another 20 electoral votes. ‘Shockingly, even this narrow way 
of looking at just our 2,000 mules in these swing states gives Trump the 
win with 279 electoral votes to Biden’s 259,’ says D’Souza.” <a

One: SUMMARY OF ELECTION FRAUD IN THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN THE 
SWING STATES: I am pleased to share a Report that is fully verified, most 
of the information was gotten from Government Sources, Tapes, and other 
Public Records, and compiled by the most highly qualified Election Experts 
in the Country. These numbers are determinative and, in all cases, are 
hundreds of thousands of Votes per Swing State more than I needed to WIN 
that State. If the Republican Senate does not step forward and address 
this ATROCITY, it will happen again, and be virtually impossible for 
Republicans to WIN ELECTIONS in the future. <a

Two: Remember, I was not campaigning—The 2020 Election was LONG OVER. What 
I was doing is bringing to light the fact that the Election was, without 
question, Rigged and Stolen. As President, and Commander-in-Chief, it was 
my duty to do so! If I did not do this, I would have been in violation of 
my Oath of Office, and the Take Care Clause, which requires the President 
to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Therefore I am 
entitled to Total Immunity, because that is exactly what I was doing, 
Taking Care of our Country, and Guarding it from Rigged and Stolen 
Elections. Democrats are willing to play a far different game. They are 
willing to Cheat at levels never seen before. <a

Three: Please study these numbers carefully, analyze what’s been done, 
keep an open mind, and be smart—Because the Democrats are already trying 
to do it again, but adding one more weapon, Prosecutorial Misconduct—Using 
the DOJ, FBI, and local Attorney Generals and D.A.’s to go after Crooked 
Joe Biden’s Political Opponent—ME. This is a Lethal Weapon, but so far my 
Record Poll Numbers would indicate that it has backfired on them. The

years ago (how time flies!), Director Chris Columbus, and others, were 
begging me to make a cameo appearance in Home Alone 2. They rented the 
Plaza Hotel in New York, which I owned at the time. I was very busy, and 
didn’t want to do it. They were very nice, but above all, persistent. I 
agreed, and the rest is history! That little cameo took off like a rocket, 
and the movie was a big success, and still is, especially around Christmas 
time. People call me whenever it is aired. Now, however, 30 years later, 
Columbus (what was his real name?) put out a statement that I bullied 
myself into the movie. Nothing could be further from the truth. That cameo 
helped make the movie a success, but if they felt bullied, or didn’t want 
me, why did they put me in, and keep me there, for over 30 years? Because 
I was, and still am, great for the movie, that’s why! Just another 
Hollywood guy from the past looking for a quick fix of Trump publicity for 
himself!</p>"},{"date":1703709284330,"favorites":9553,"id":"111654291655297747","isRetweet":false,"retweets":2528,"text":"<p><a

von Spakovsky, The Daily Signal: “First, Section 3 of the 14 Amendment 
applies only to individuals who were previously a ‘member of Congress,’ an 
‘officer of the United States,’ or a state official. Individuals who are 
elected—such as the president and vice president—are not officers within 
the meaning of Section 3. Second, no federal court has convicted Trump of 
engaging in ‘insurrection or rebellion.’ In fact, the Senate acquitted 
Trump of that charge in his second impeachment. Third, some scholars 
assert Section 3 doesn’t even exist anymore as a constitutional matter 
after the Amnesty Acts of 1872 and 1898—a matter completely ignored by the 
court today. Fourth, prior court rulings have held that Section 3 is not 
self-executing and Congress has never passed any federal law providing for 
enforcement, meaning that courts such as the Colorado Supreme Court have 
no legal authority to enforce Section 3.” <a

bank or insurance company brought in to say, ‘Donald Trump ruined us … or 
at least profoundly damaged us … or maybe, you know, shaved a few shekels 
off some middle-manager’s annual bonus...’ This raises two questions: 
First, how many businesses would emerge unscathed, under the law as New

unabashed partisanship? Second, why conduct business in New York if

a third-party appraiser, could the AG go after that seller for repeated

wouldn’t let this “case” go to the Commercial Division, where it belongs 
(would have been TERMINATED), incredibly ignored the Appellate Court 
decision that struck down almost 90% of this fake lawsuit based on Statute 
of Limitations, etc., and, Illegally and Unconstitutionally Gagged me and 
my lawyers, in a brazen and blatant attempt to prevent us from bringing 
vital information to the Public and the Courts. The Racist Attorney 
General, and the Runaway Judge, are causing grave damage to our Justice 
System, to New York State, and to the United States of America! They 
attempted to use a disgusting and unfair Statute, which has never been 
used for this purpose before. I am not allowed a Jury, and they have, 
essentially, taken away my Rights. It is a Rigged Court in a Rigged New

The Statements showed great liquidity, Hundreds of Millions of Dollars in

determined in Court that because of this great liquidity, a Bank Loan was 
not even necessary. The Bank wanted to make the Deal more than I did, and 
they were thrilled with the end result—PROFITS AND SUCCESS! There were no 
Victims, other than me, in having to deal with a totally corrupt 
Prosecutor and Judge. He refused to give me a Jury and UNCONSTITUTIONALLY 
GAGGED ME about very important information. The New York State Attorney 
General, who has total control of the Judge, used this case to run for

Stefanik: “In NY, President Trump is facing a two-pronged attack. 
Soros-funded Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg issued the original indictment in a 
case so absurd that even the Washington Post’s liberal editorial board 
called it a ‘shaky’ case. At the same time, New York’s Democrat AG Letitia 
James teamed up with Democrat Judge Arthur Engoron to try to put the Trump 
Organization out of business. Recall that James campaigned on targeting 
Trump. She said that going after him was her primary motivation to run for 
office and that she’s got her ‘eyes on Trump Tower.’ Attorney General 
James’ case doesn’t even have a victim. President Trump repaid the loans 
to the banks in full and on time. The ‘crime’ in question is that 
President Trump is leading Joe Biden in the polls...This unprecedented 
lawfare against President Trump cannot continue. The American people are 
the guardians of democracy, which is why, in 2024, the American people 
must and will elect President Trump back to the White 
House.”</p>"},{"date":1702142152940,"favorites":14317,"id":"111551588135419982","isRetweet":false,"retweets":3732,"text":"<p>The

with, I thought Ron DeSanctimonious was terrible, with his bobble head 
facial movements &amp; his walking on eggs, but that Sloppy Chris Christie

suffers from TDS, or Trump Derangement Syndrome, at levels not seen 
before. In other words, he is a “sick puppy.” On top of it all, his poll 
numbers are just 1%, in a class with “Aida” Hutchinson. He’s dead, but so 
is Ron, whose weird bobbing head and fresh mouth, make his high heels look 
good - He’s walking on eggs! Birdbrain looked different &amp; lost, but I

came to Mar-a-Lago after the RIGGED election because, “the former

not depressed, I WAS ANGRY, and it was not that I was not eating, it was 
that I was eating too much. But that’s not why Keven McCarthy was there. 
He was at Mar-a-Lago to get my support, and to bring the Republican Party 
together - Only good intentions. Liz Cheney, on the other hand, went on to 
lose her seat in Congress by the largest margin for a sitting

that the bank’s revenues from its relationship with Trump went up and up

from about $13,000 in 2011 to a projected $6 million in 2013, according to 
a bank document,’ the Associated Press reported. Deutsche Bank executives, 
per the Associated Press, referred to Trump as a ‘whale’ of a client, one 
they enthusiastically pursued. </p><p>In 2014, also according to the 
Associated Press, Vrablic’s ‘direct boss went to lunch with Trump to thank 
him and ‘ask whether we can work on other opportunities with them,’ 
according to a document for that meeting.’ </p><p>In short: Deutsche Bank

Williams, a Deutsche Bank managing director who was involved in approving 
loans to the Trump Organization for several of its most prominent 
properties, testified as a defense witness. Williams said that before 
making the loans, Deutsche Bank did its own due diligence on Trump’s net 
worth and the values of his properties. When a Trump lawyer asked, ‘Is the 
bank capable of reaching its own judgment based on the evaluation it makes 
of the guarantor’s financial condition?’ Williams answered, ‘Certainly, 
yes.’”</p><p>Then Williams said, ‘As part of our due diligence, we subject 
a client’s asset value to adjustments. It’s part of our underwriting 
process. We apply it to every client regardless of what’s reported.’ 
Trump’s lawyer asked: ‘Is a difference of opinion in asset values between 
the client and the bank a disqualifying factor to extend credit?’ Williams 
answered, ‘No.’ The lawyer asked why not. Williams answered, ‘It’s just a 
difference of opinion.’” <a

have Uncovered screenshots from the X account of Dawn Marie Engoron, the 
wife of Leftist NYC Judge Arthur Engoron, who is overseeing the civil 
fraud  against President Trump that shows that she has been posting 
attacks on Trump from her account <span class=\"h-card\"><a

</p><p>This is incredible bias. On or around November 7th, she posted 
tweets in which she said “FUCK TRUMP”. She posted photoshopped pics of 
President Trump in an orange jump suit, she attacked me during my Live 
show a few weeks ago for exposing her husband, and she is openly  
attacking President Trump’s lawyer Alina Habba. </p><p>Nobody can actually 
say this is a fair

</p><p>Judge Arthur Engoron has made the Trump trial a family affair and 
potentially has reserved seats for his son, Ian Engoron, who may be 
financially benefiting from the Trump Trial via his position at an 
Democrat activist law firm in New York City, and his father’s position as 
the judge overseeing Trump’s trial in NYC. </p><p>During my investigation 
into communist NYC judge Arthur Engoron, I discovered that he has 4 
children. </p><p>His son’s name is Ian, and he often references his son in 
his writings on “The Wheatley Alumni Newsletter”, which is operated and 
controlled by Arthur Engoron. </p><p>I have every edition archived. 
</p><p>Ian Engoron is a radical leftist lawyer who works as an “Associate 
Shareholder” at the activist “Olsham Law Firm” in New York City. 
</p><p>“Shareholder activism” implies that Ian is working to secure 
financial deals for his law firm and their investors based off of 
political outcomes and political influence.

Politics: Williams said Deutsche Bank offers flexible loan terms to 
clients like Trump to benefit their business strategy to “grow [their] 
noncredit relationship with the firm.” They prioritize high net worth 
client’s “broader relationship” with the bank, he said. At the end of 
Williams’ testimony, Trump’s attorney Chris Kise renewed a motion for a 
directed verdict to toss out the case against Trump and his company, 
arguing that Williams’ testimony confirms the bank had no problem with the 
loans to Trump Org...Kise cited testimony from the banker that “large 
changes to net worth were not unusual.” The banker’s testimony proves 
there was no intent to defraud and no materiality to any alleged 
discrepancies in Trump’s personal financial statements submitted to the 
bank, Kise added. “The bank made decision based on its own analysis,” Kise

from Highly Respected Congressman Troy Nehls of Texas: “He’s the Leader of 
our Party. He’s crushing all the Candidates, he’s crushing the Florida 
Governor, and everybody else in the Race. The American People, the 
Republican Party have made it very, very clear in Polling that Donald 
Trump will be our Republican Nominee, and every decision I think we make 
within the Republican Conference should make sure that we get the White 
House back in 2024. I tell you, we’ve had the Majority. When you don’t 
have the White House, you ain’t getting a whole hell of a lot done. It’s 
quite clear. So, our focus should be 2024, and you say “Kingmaker,” I’ll 
say this. When you look at the 2022 Midterms, there’s 150, almost 160 
Members of the House in the Republican Conference that received Donald 
Trump’s Endorsement, so I believe Donald Trump has an enormous amount of 
support, the base, the bottom, the floor, in my opinion, would be 150, 160 
Republicans supporting Donald 
Trump.”</p>"},{"date":1701280133694,"favorites":6557,"id":"111495094836832230","isRetweet":false,"retweets":1617,"text":"<p>Congressman

C. McCarthy: “In reality, it is not the government but the Democratic 
Party that has an interest in a speedy trial — i.e., one that ties its 
main political opponent up in court and generates negative publicity for 
him during key junctures of the campaign. If the chief concern were due 
process rather than electoral politics, the Justice Department and the 
court would not be prejudiced in the slightest if Trump’s trial were 
postponed until after the November 5, 2024, election. If that happened, 
Trump’s free-speech and fair-trial rights would be protected with no harm 
to the administration of 
justice.”</p>"},{"date":1700772064848,"favorites":11688,"id":"111461798041587443","isRetweet":false,"retweets":3220,"text":"<p>“The

as a response to prejudicial statements made by the prosecutor and the

Reynolds of Iowa has gone from a popular Governor to the MOST UNPOPULAR 
GOVERNOR IN THE UNITED STATES, not an easy feat. Her Endorsement of Ron 
DeSanctimonious, who is 50 Points down to me in the Polls, has given him 
exactly ZERO “Bounce.” He is a wounded bird falling violently from the 
sky. I wonder what position Kim was promised in order to back someone who 
is sooo far down? I got Iowa “First in the Nation,” Ethanol security, and 
28 Billion Dollars for our Great Farmers. I also protected Social Security 
and MediCare. DeSanctimonious and Birdbrain did NOTHING.
