sounds fair, doesn’t it? The “Justice” Department is CORRUPT. Offered 
Christopher Steele $1,000,000 to lie about me, paid Russian a fortune to 
“get Trump,” told Facebook not to mention the Hunter Biden Laptop before

Is Trump Hater Jack Smith going to investigate that? Will his Trump Hating 
boss, Lisa M, allow him to investigate the reason for January 6th, the 
corrupt 2020 Election, or the troops I recommended be

on the illegitimate Jan. 6 Committee: </p><p>The Committee held NINE 
hearings before voting to subpoena President Trump.</p><p>If they were 
serious about finding the truth, why didn't they subpoena the President 
months ago?</p><p>This subpoena was never about seeking the truth–this was 
about taking out President Trump and his allies right before the midterm 
elections. </p><p>The Committee doctored evidence, and their \"star 
witnesses\" have proven to be frauds.</p><p>This Committee is nothing but 
a 
sham.</p>"},{"date":1668679264255,"favorites":15370,"id":"109358564261958376","isRetweet":false,"retweets":2660,"text":"<p><span

A bad show that’s not funny or smart. L.M. is angry and exhausted, the

Schmidt, the highly respected Attorney General of the Great State of 
Kansas, has done an absolutely outstanding job—HE HAS KEPT KANSAS SAFE.  
Derek is now running for Governor and will be a popular and very wise 
choice.  He is Strong on Crime, the Borders, and our always under siege 
Second Amendment. He loves our Military and our Vets.  Derek Schmidt will 
never let you down, and has my Complete and Total

read in, of all places, The New York Times, that the Broken Old Crow, 
Mitch McConnell, has lost every single time to me in his cherished Senate 
races. I am 42-0 over the last two cycles, &amp; never even tried to run 
up the score by opposing Todd Young of Indiana, or John Thune of South 
Dakota - They may be RINO’s, and puppets of Mitch, but they are just fine. 
Do I also get credit for endorsing Mitch himself, who was heading for a 
landslide LOSS until he begged me to Endorse him. Sadly, I 
did!</p>"},{"date":1666018771303,"favorites":22050,"id":"109184206195801630","isRetweet":false,"retweets":5779,"text":"<p>There’s 
this RINO character in the Great State of Colorado, Joe O’Dea, that is 
running against the incumbent Democrat for the United States Senate, who 
is having a good old time saying that he wants to “distance” himself from 
President Trump, and other slightly nasty things. He should look at the 
Economy, Inflation, Energy Independence, defeating ISIS, the Strongest 
EVER Border, Great Trade Deals, &amp; much more, before he speaks. MAGA 
doesn’t Vote for stupid people with big mouths. Good luck
