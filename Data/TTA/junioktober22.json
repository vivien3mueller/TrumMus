How do we know that Obama, VP Biden, Bush 43, VP Cheney did not remove

they acquired, but was there any kind of search of the homes of any of 
these former top officials?  Indeed, has there been any kind of 
substantive inquiry?  How about former attorneys general, former CIA 
directors, and the like?

crap. The 1917 Espionage Act cannot apply to a President.  Under Article 
II, first sentence of Section I, he is the executive branch.  He is free 
to do as he wishes with these documents, including deciding as president 
to remove them as he leaves office. I suspect former presidents have done 
so. Unless and until a subpoena is issued to search Obama’s various 
estates, we won’t know. That said, this entire process is a subterfuge, as 
I’ve explained here, on radio and 
TV.</p>"},{"date":1665167867056,"favorites":0,"id":"109128441335167782","isRetweet":true,"retweets":0,"text":"<p>RT

and I send our deepest respect and condolences to the memory of a truly 
great man and Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe of Japan. Quite frankly, there 
was nobody like him. He loved his country and fought so hard that it 
remained free and safe. We became very close friends, and there was nobody 
with a greater passion for peace than Shinzo. The world has lost a truly 
incredible leader—but his words and thoughts will never be forgotten. He 
will be greatly missed by
